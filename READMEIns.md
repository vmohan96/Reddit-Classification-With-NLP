# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

### Description

In this project you'll use your skills with Python, machine learning, APIs, and NLP. 

For project 3, your goal is two-fold:
1. Using [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API, collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.
2. Then use NLP to train a classifier to determine which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.


#### About the API

Pushshift's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is use the following url: https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?subreddit=boardgames

To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use the API: https://youtu.be/AcrjEWsMi_E

### Requirements

- Gather and prepare your data using the `requests` library.
- **Create and compare at least two models**. One of these must be a Bayes classifier, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.
- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.
- An executive summary of your results.
- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.

**Pro Tip:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).

---

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Code and executive summary must be in a clearly commented Jupyter Notebook.
- You must submit your slide deck by **10:00 AM ET, Friday, October 9**.
- Your repo must be submitted by **9:00PM on Friday, October 9**.

## Rubric
Your instructional team will evaluate your project using the following criteria.  

For Project 3 the evaluation categories are as follows:<br>
**The Data Science Process**
- Problem Statement
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- Preprocessing & Modeling
- Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding
- Conclusion and Recommendations

**Organization and Professionalism**
- Organization
- Visualizations
- Python Syntax and Control Flow
- Presentation

**Scores will be out of 30 points based on the 10 categories in the rubric.** <br>
*3 points per section*<br>

| Score | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |
| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |


### The Data Science Process

**Problem Statement**
- Is it clear what the goal of the project is?
- What type of model will be developed?
- How will success be evaluated?
- Is the scope of the project appropriate?
- Is it clear who cares about this or why this is important to investigate?
- Does the student consider the audience?

**Data Collection**
- Was enough data gathered to generate a significant result?
- Was data collected that was useful and relevant to the project?
- Was thought given to the server receiving the requests such as considering number of requests per second?

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Are missing values imputed/handled reasonably?
- Are distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?
- Does the student address whether they are likely to be able to answer their problem statement with the provided data given what they've discovered during EDA?

**Preprocessing and Modeling**
- Is text data successfully converted to a numeric representation?
- Are methods such as stop words, stemming, and lemmatization explored?
- Does the student properly split and/or sample the data for validation/training purposes?
- Does the student test and evaluate a variety of models to identify a production algorithm (**AT MINIMUM:** Bayes and one other model)?
- Does the student defend their choice of a final model relevant to the data at hand and the problem?
- Does the student explain how the model works and evaluate its performance successes/downfalls?

**Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding**
- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem objective?
- Does the student interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?
- Is domain knowledge demonstrated when interpreting results?
- Does the student provide appropriate interpretation with regards to any descriptive and inferential statistics?

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- Does the student provide appropriate context to connect individual steps back to the overall project?
- Are the conclusions/recommendations clearly stated?
- Does the conclusion answer the original problem statement?
- Are future steps to move the project forward identified?


### Organization and Professionalism

**Project Organization**
- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Are data imported/saved using relative paths?
- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?
- Is Markdown formatting used appropriately to structure notebooks?
- Is the process explained in comments/Markdown?
- Are files & directories organized?
- Do files and directories have well-structured, appropriate, consistent names?

**Visualizations**
- Are sufficient visualizations provided?
- Do plots accurately demonstrate valid relationships?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Are plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?

**Python Syntax and Control Flow**
- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follows general best practices and style guidelines?

**Presentation**
- Is the problem statement clearly presented?
- Does a strong narrative run through the presentation building toward a final conclusion?
- Are the conclusions/recommendations clearly stated?
- Is the level of technicality appropriate for the intended audience?
- Does the student appropriately pace their presentation?
- Does the student deliver their message with clarity and volume?
- Are appropriate visualizations generated for the intended audience?
- Are visualizations necessary and useful for supporting conclusions/explaining findings?

### Why did we choose this project?
This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification, Natural Language Processing, and Data Acquisition.
